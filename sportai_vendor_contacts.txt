## 🎯 Vendor Negotiation Tips

### Leverage Points:
1. **Multi-unit purchase** - Ask for 10-15% discount for buying 3-4 units
2. **Case study opportunity** - Offer to be a showcase facility for marketing
3. **Social media promotion** - Tag them in posts, testimonials
4. **Bundle pricing** - Buy annual contracts upfront for discount
5. **Referral agreement** - Commit to referring other facilities

### Questions to Always Ask:
- "What's your best price for a multi-unit order?"
- "What's included vs additional cost?"
- "What happens if equipment fails during installation?"
- "Can we get a trial or demo period?"
- "What's the total cost of ownership over 3 years?"
- "Do you offer financing or payment plans?"

### Red Flags to Watch:
- ⚠️ Unwilling to provide references
- ⚠️ Vague on installation requirements
- ⚠️ Hidden annual fees not disclosed upfront
- ⚠️ No warranty or very short warranty period
- ⚠️ Pushy on immediate decision without demo
